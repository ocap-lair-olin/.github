# Olin College Aquaculture Profiler

90% of the seafood consumed by Americans is imported, valued at $21.5 billion a year. America is lagging behind in seafood and aquaculture production. The goal of the OCAP project is to create a mobile aquaculture moored profiling robot that monitors the environment inside the fishpen. This will allow farmers to better monitor their fish and make improved decisions that account for the variety of factors that contribute to fish health and environmental conditions.
